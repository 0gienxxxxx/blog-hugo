This is my personal homepage. 

The static site is generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and is deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The source code is availlable on [Github](https://github.com/orianna-zzo/blog-hugo). The theme is [cocoa](http://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme).

Now it is a beta 0.2 version. Beta 0.1 version is generated by jekyll. I am still exploring how to build my expected homepage. ^-^
